                        <p>Hi I'm Charles! 👋🏻</p>
                        <p>I am a Data Scientist, Web Developer, and third year Computer Science student at Louisiana State University</p>
                        <p>
                            My first year of college was spent at Rochester Institute of Technology where I was on the executive board of
                            The Computer Science House and a maintainer of our internet connected vending machines project
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From February 2022 to June 2023 I worked at Bryx bringing a Records Management System from conception to
                            production as well as being head of multiple internal projects
                        </p>
